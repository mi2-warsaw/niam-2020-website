    NIAM is a place for discussion and learning the most recent advances in the above areas. \\
    The essence of the workshop are poster sessions preceded by short (3-5 min) flash talks and also small group activities and discussions.
    To enhance networking and exchange of experience, we plan to focus this event on specific areas of ML and to keep it relatively small (around 30 participants).
