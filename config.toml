    NIAM is a place for discussion and learning the most recent advances in the above areas. \\
    The essence of the workshop are poster sessions preceded by short (3-5 min) flash talks and also small group activities and discussions.
    To enhance networking and exchange of experience, we plan to focus this event on specific areas of ML and to keep it relatively small (around 30 participants).
    <br />
    <br />
    The subject areas of NIAM include, but are not limited to: \\
    - <b><font size="5">N</font>avigated Machine Learning.</b> All topics related to navigating the hyperparameter tuning procedure. \\
    - <b><font size="5">I</font>nterpretable Machine Learning.</b> Techniques for explaining black-box models and training accurate interpretable glass-box models.  \\
    - <b><font size="5">A</font>utomated Machine Learning.</b> Methods for quickly and easily building highly accurate models. \\
    - <b><font size="5">M</font>achine Learning as a data-oriented service.</b> All ML-related topics, including Meta-Learning and Evidence-Based Machine Learning. """
